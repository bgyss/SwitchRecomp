# Golden Trace Guidance

This project does not distribute proprietary assets or traces derived from copyrighted content.

## How to Add New Traces
- Collect traces privately from legally obtained inputs.
- Store only non-proprietary summaries (hashes, event counts, timing stats).
- Do not commit raw traces that embed copyrighted data.

## Recommended Metadata
- Title identifier and version.
- Tool versions used for tracing.
- Hashes of input binaries/assets (recorded in provenance).
