# Validation Artifacts Samples

This directory contains non-proprietary examples for validation artifact indexing.

- `artifacts.example.json` is a template for the artifact index consumed by
  `recomp-validation artifacts`. Update paths to point at external captures,
  intake manifests, and pipeline outputs.

Do not place real captures, keys, or proprietary inputs in this directory.
